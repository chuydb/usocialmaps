#Hello, this is magic ! #

Live demo: ([MBoilerplate](http://mboilerplate.appspot.com))

*The materialize boilerplate project is an amazing fusion from material design, polymer web components, and boilerplate framework for easy and quick deployments of web applications on the Google Cloud Platform.*

###What's Materialize?
Materialize simplifies life for developers and the users they serve. It speeds up development, heavy lifting has been done for you to provide a smoother experience for visitors. ([showcase](http://materializecss.com/showcase.html))

###What's Polymer?
Polymer lets you build encapsulated, re-usable elements that work just like HTML elements, to use in building web applications. It makes it easier than ever to make fast, beautiful, and interoperable web components. ([polymer-project](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/))


###What's Boilerplate?
A Boilerplate is used to describe sections of code that can be reused over and over in new contexts or applications which provides good default values, reducing the need to specify program details in every project. ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code))

#####Security
**SSL**

+ SSL is enabled site wide by adding <tt>secure: always</tt> to the section: <tt>- url: /.*</tt> in app.yaml (remove this line to disable)
+ SSL either requires a free google app engine *.appspot.com domain or a [custom domain and certificate](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/ssl)
+ Alternatively SSL can be enabled at a controller level via webapp2 schemes. Use the secure_scheme provided in routes.py
+ It is recommended to enable ssl site wide to help prevent [session hijacking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking)

**Passwords**

+ Passwords are hashed and encrypted with SHA512 and PyCrypto.

**CSRF**

+ [Cross-site request forgery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) protection
